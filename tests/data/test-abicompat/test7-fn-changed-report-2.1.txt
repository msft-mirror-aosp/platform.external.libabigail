functions defined in library 'libtest7-fn-changed-libapp-btf-v1.so'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test7-fn-changed-app.btf' expects:

  function float add(float, float):
    return type changed:
      type name changed from 'float' to 'int'
      type size hasn't changed
      mangled name changed from 'float' to int

  function void print(const Student):
    parameter 1 of type 'const Student' has sub-type changes:
      in unqualified underlying type 'struct Student':
        type size changed from 128 to 192 (in bits)
        1 data member insertion:
          'float percentage', at offset 128 (in bits)
