functions defined in library 'libtest10-with-incompatible-exported-symbols.so.abi'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test10-app-with-undefined-symbols.abi' expects:

  method int some_type::get_first_member():
    return type changed:
      entity changed from 'int' to 'int*'
      type size changed from 32 to 64 (in bits)

  method char some_type::get_second_member():
    return type changed:
      entity changed from 'char' to 'char*'
      type size changed from 8 to 64 (in bits)
